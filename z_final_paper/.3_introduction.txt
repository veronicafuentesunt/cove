\section*{Introduction}

Recent advances in stress monitoring have demonstrated that heart rate variability (HRV) is a sensitive and informative biomarker. By measuring the differences between consecutive heartbeats, HRV reveals the response of the autonomic nervous system to stress. Numerous studies have linked reduced HRV to higher stress levels, suggesting that it may serve as an early indicator of mental health crises. These insights have encouraged researchers to apply advanced machine learning techniques to HRV data in order to derive actionable insights and establish a strong basis for proactive mental health interventions.
In addition, the integration of diverse data sources has broadened research opportunities. Wearable sensors record physiological signals, while digital logs of daily behaviors provide additional context for analysis. This combined strategy, known as digital phenotyping, continuously monitors behavioral patterns and digital footprints to produce an objective and comprehensive view of an individualâ€™s mental state. These emerging methods enhance early detection of potential crises and enable the personalization of interventions, ultimately transforming mental health care strategies.
Mental health crises can emerge unexpectedly, making timely and effective intervention challenging for both individuals and providers. Although significant progress has been made in treatment, accurately forecasting such events remains difficult owing to the complexity and unpredictability of human behavior. Early intervention is essential to prevent escalation and provide support before conditions deteriorate dramatically. This study addresses these challenges through the development of an AI-powered predictive algorithm that continuously monitors daily behavioral patterns to detect early warning signs, allowing for prompt and personalized interventions.
